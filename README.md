# animate
A python script which makes it easier to animate game sprites when using Pygame

# about
I decided to create this script during my time making 2d games with Python after noticing Pygame has no inbuilt functions for creating animated sprites. It is fairly simple to use, and provides good performance and flexibility.

# usage
The documentation is all in the code
I explain how to use each function along with its parameters
